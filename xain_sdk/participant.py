        A model is given in terms of its weights and the model is trained on the participant's
        dataset for a number of epochs. The weights of the updated model are returned in combination
        with the number of samples of the train dataset and some gathered metrics.

        If no weights are given (i.e. an empty list of weights), then the participant is expected to
        initialize the weights according to its model definition and return them without training.

        Args:
            weights (~typing.List[~numpy.ndarray]): The weights of the model to be trained.
            epochs (int): The number of epochs to be trained.
            epoch_base (int): The epoch base number for the optimizer state (in case of epoch
                dependent optimizer parameters).

        Returns:
            ~typing.Tuple[~typing.List[~numpy.ndarray], int, ~typing.Dict[str, ~numpy.ndarray]]: The
                updated model weights, the number of training samples and the gathered metrics.
